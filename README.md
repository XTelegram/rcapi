3. Press on `Database` under `Deployment` Header, your created cluster will be there.
5. Press on connect, choose `Allow Acces From Anywhere` and press on `Add IP Address` without editing the ip, then create user.
6. After creating user press on `Choose a connection`, then press on `Connect your application`. Choose `Driver` **python** and `version` **3.6 or later**.
7. Copy your `connection string` and replace `<password>` with the password of your user, then press close.

**Notes**:
- When you create rclone.conf file add at least two accounts if you want to copy from cloud to cloud. 
- For those on android phone, you can use [RCX app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.github.x0b.rcx&hl=en_IN&gl=US) app to create rclone.conf file. Use "Export rclone config" option in app menu to get config file.
- Rclone supported providers:
  > 1Fichier, Amazon Drive, Amazon S3, Backblaze B2, Box, Ceph, DigitalOcean Spaces, Dreamhost, **Dropbox**,   Enterprise File Fabric, FTP, GetSky, Google Cloud Storage, **Google Drive**, Google Photos, HDFS, HTTP, Hubic, IBM COS S3, Koofr, Mail.ru Cloud, **Mega**, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, **Microsoft OneDrive**, **Nextcloud**, OVH, OpenDrive, Oracle Cloud Storage, ownCloud, pCloud, premiumize.me, put.io, Scaleway, Seafile, SFTP, **WebDAV**, Yandex Disk, etc. **Check all providers on official site**: [Click here](https://rclone.org/#providers).

## Getting Google OAuth API credential file and token.pickle

**NOTES**
- You need OS with a browser.
- Windows users should install python3 and pip. You can find how to install and use them from google.
- You can ONLY open the generated link from `generate_drive_token.py` in local browser.

1. Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Go to the OAuth Consent tab, fill it, and save.
3. Go to the Credentials tab and click Create Credentials -> OAuth Client ID
4. Choose Desktop and Create.
5. Publish your OAuth consent screen App to prevent **token.pickle** from expire
6. Use the download button to download your credentials.
7. Move that file to the root of rclone-tg-bot, and rename it to **credentials.json**
8. Visit [Google API page](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library)
9. Search for Google Drive Api and enable it
10. Finally, run the script to generate **token.pickle** file for Google Drive:
```
pip3 install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
python3 generate_drive_token.py
```

## Using Service Accounts to avoid user rate limit [For Google Drive Remotes]

>**NOTE**: Using Service Accounts is only recommended for Team Drive.

### 1. Generate Service Accounts. 

**Warning**: Abuse of this feature is not the aim of this project and we do not recommend that you make a lot of projects, just one project and 100 SAs allow you plenty of use, its also possible that over abuse might get your projects banned by Google.

>**NOTE**: If you have created SAs in past from this script, you can also just re download the keys by running:
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
>**NOTE:** 1 Service Account can copy around 750 GB a day, 1 project can make 100 Service Accounts so you can copy 75 TB a day.

#### Two methods to create service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Create Service Accounts in existed Project (Recommended Method)

- List your projects ids
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --list-projects
```
- Enable services automatically by this command
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --enable-services $PROJECTID
```
- Create Sevice Accounts to current project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --create-sas $PROJECTID
```
- Download Sevice Accounts as accounts folder
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --download-keys $PROJECTID
```
##### 2. Create Service Accounts in New Project
```
python3 gen_sa_accounts.py --quick-setup 1 --new-only
```
A folder named accounts will be created which will contain keys for the Service Accounts.

### 2. Add Service Accounts

#### Two methods to add service accounts
Choose one of these methods

##### 1. Add Them To Google Group then to Team Drive (Recommended)
- Mount accounts folder
```
cd accounts
```
- Grab emails form all accounts to emails.txt file that would be created in accounts folder
- `For Windows using PowerShell`
```
$emails = Get-ChildItem .\**.json |Get-Content -Raw |ConvertFrom-Json |Select -ExpandProperty client_email >>emails.txt
```
- `For Linux`
```
grep -oPh '"client_email": "\K[^"]+' *.json > emails.txt
```
- Unmount acounts folder
```
cd ..
```
Then add emails from emails.txt to Google Group, after that add this Google Group to your Shared Drive and promote it to manager and delete email.txt file from accounts folder

##### 2. Add Them To Team Drive Directly
- Run:
```
python3 add_to_team_drive.py -d SharedTeamDriveSrcID
```
------

## Yt-dlp and Aria2c Authentication Using .netrc File
For using your premium accounts in yt-dlp or for protected Index Links, create .netrc and not netrc, this file will be hidden, so view hidden files to edit it after creation. Use following format on file: 

Format:
```
machine host login username password my_password
```
Example:
```
machine example.workers.dev login index_username password index_password
```
**Note**: Using aria2c you can also use without username. Multiple accounts of different hosts can be added each separated by a new line.

**Youtube Note**: For `youtube` authentication use [cookies.txt](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-youtube-dl) file.
